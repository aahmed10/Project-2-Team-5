## Project Proposal:

### Goal
The app will allow users to simplify and redact receipes by using a text field/bookletmarklet to run custom javascript to store recipes in a database and presented in a user friendly format. 

### Behind the Workings
User submits a link to the app. The app extracts semantic markups, identifies recipes, and stores into a database. The user will then access his or her recipes via his or her login account.
